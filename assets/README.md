This folder should contain all static content from outside sources which is
neither code nor generated by code. This includes, but is not limited to,
schematics generated from biorender, other images taken from outside sources,
`csl` files, `bib` files (**NOTE: WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THIS WORKS WITH QUARTO,
WITH R MARKDOWN THE CSL AND BIB ACTED WEIRD IN OTHER LOCATIONS**), and pdf files
of references.
