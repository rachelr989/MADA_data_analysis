This is where you should store the results of computations that produce
large files, such as posterior samples from Bayesian models.

Everything in this folder except for the README is ignored by Git, so it will
not be synced by GitHub. You will need to manually sync those files, either
by using a physical drive or a separate cloud-based file storage platform, like
Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive (OneDrive is preferred for ahgroup projects,
since UGA pays for OneDrive). If you use a cloud service, you should add the
link to the storage location and instructions for obtaining access (e.g. email
you and you will set up sharing permissions) HERE.

Instructions for obtaining large files: email/discord message/etc. INFO HERE.
