Folder for any large files that are too big to be tracked with GitHub.
That's generally anything above around 20MB. 

This folder is set in .gitignore to be ignored when pushing/pulling. This allows large files to be part of the project. If you want to collaborate with someone or work on multiple computers, you need to manually share/transfer everything in this folder, e.g. by Dropbox/OneDrive/etc.
