This folder contains results produced by the code, such as figures and tables, and other files.

A special folder for large files exists. This folder is set in .gitignore to be ignored when pushing/pulling. This allows large files to be part of the project. If you want to collaborate with someone or work on multiple computers, you need to manually share/transfer everything in this folder, e.g. by Dropbox/OneDrive/etc.

If you have a Dropbox/OneDrive/etc. link, add that link here:
`LINK-GOES-HERE`.

Structure the folders inside `results` such that they make sense for your specific analysis. Provide enough documentation that someone can understand what you are doing and what goes where. `readme.md` files inside each folder are a good idea.
